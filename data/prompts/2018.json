Concurrently, NYSERDA submitted a comprehensive filing to the New York State Department of Public Service (DPS)\n“Launching New York’s Offshore Wind Industry: Phase 1 Report”\n[PDF]\n. The Report documents the successful results of New York’s first large-scale offshore wind solicitation with a combined total capacity of nearly 1,700 megawatts and provides important details about these, the highest scoring projects. These publications are a significant milestone in the State's commitment to transparency as it delivers the promise of a clean electricity future.\nThe Report is an analysis of the solicitation process and includes details of the executed contracts, including:\nUnprecedented competition:\nNew York’s first procurement garnered the most competitive market response to date among all U.S. state offshore wind solicitations and demonstrates New York’s unparalleled reach to existing lease areas spanning New England to New Jersey and that New York State’s procurement mechanism for Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificates (ORECs) is widely seen as attractive to private developers in the U.S. offshore wind market.\nCost-effectiveness:\nThe Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind projects have an average all-in development cost of $83.36 per megawatt hour (2018 dollars) with an expected average OREC cost of $25.14 per megawatt hour. The average bill impact for residential customers will be less than a dollar per month per customer – approximately $0.73. These prices are approximately 40 percent less than projected by NYSERDA’s 2018 analysis, signaling that offshore wind is an increasingly competitively priced renewable energy resource.\nInnovation Contracting Structure\n: The contracts utilize an innovative Index OREC contracting structure where payments rise and fall inversely to a composite average of New York’s energy and capacity market prices, which do not reflect actual project revenues but do provide protection for ratepayers and projects against volatility in utility bills and project revenue, respectively.\nEnvironmental, Fishing and Ocean Use Priorities:\nThese projects demonstrate a strong commitment through the inclusion of mitigation plans that actively address the interests of ocean users such as commercial and recreational fishing and environmental stakeholders and ensure that coastal communities will be fully engaged and informed during the development and construction process.\nProtecting New York Families:\nThese projects will provide approximately $700 million of avoided health impact benefits in the form of avoided hospitalization and premature death associated with asthma and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, demonstrating tremendous economic and societal value for New York families.\nRead the Phase One Report Factsheet\n[PDF]\n.\nClosed Solicitation, ORECRFP18-1\nSchedule\nDate\nEvent\nNovember 8, 2018\nRFP Release Date\nFebruary 14, 2019\nDeadline for Submission of Proposals\nSpring 2019\nAwardees Notified\nSummer 2019\nContracts Awarded\nFall 2019\nContracts Finalized and\nPhase 1 Report\n[PDF]\nfiled with the New York State Public Service Commission\nORECRFP18-1 and Appendices\nRequest for Proposals\n[PDF]\nSummary of Revisions\n[PDF]\nAppendix A - Notice of Intent to Propose\n[PDF]\nAppendix B - Proposal Certification Form\n[PDF]\nAppendix C - Economic Benefits Claims and Verifications\n[PDF]\nAppendix D - Elements of the Fisheries Mitigation Plan\n[PDF]\nAppendix E - Elements of the Environmental Mitigation Plan\n[PDF]\nAppendix F - Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate Standard Form Purchase and Sale Agreement\n[DOCX]\nAppendix G - Offer Data Form\n[XLSX]\nAppendix H - Master Offers Form\n[XLSX]\nAppendix I - Proposal Submission Guide\n[PDF]\nEligibility Requirements\nThe Offshore Wind Standard Order limited project eligibility to projects that generate electricity from offshore wind that:\nAre located off the coast of the United States\nBecome operational on or after January 1, 2015\nDeliver electricity into New York\nHave obtained a lease (executed or provisional) from the\nBureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)\n.\nContract Requirements\nThe Order also:\nAuthorized NYSERDA to include commitments to project labor agreements and prevailing wages as contract requirements for awarded projects\nRequired bidders to:\nSubmit a fisheries mitigation plan describing development practices that will minimize impacts to fisheries\nParticipate in New York State’s offshore wind technical working groups: Environmental, Commercial Fishing, Jobs and Supply Chain, and Maritime\nConsult with relevant State agencies around fishing, wildlife, and the environment\nMake environmental data collected during site assessment publicly available\nImplement lighting controls to minimize nighttime visibility\nMinimize visual impacts\nEvaluation Criteria\nThe Offshore Wind Standard Order prescribed the evaluation of proposals to be based upon an ultimate weighting of 70% price considerations, 20% economic benefits to New Yorkers, and 10% based on project viability.\nProposers Conference\nNYSERDA hosted a conference for proposers via webinar on November 29, 2018 to review elements of the RFP including eligibility criteria, submission requirements, the proposal evaluation process, contract commitments, and the post-award process and agreement.
