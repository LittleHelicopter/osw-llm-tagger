NYSERDA competitively selected two offshore wind projects for contract negotiation: Empire Wind 1 (developed by Equinor) and Sunrise Wind (developed by Ørsted and Eversource).\nOn February 29, 2024, Governor Hochul announced the State has awarded two offshore wind projects for contract negotiation as a result of its fourth offshore wind solicitation –\nEmpire Wind 1, a planned 810-megawatt project (developed by Equinor), and Sunrise Wind, a planned 924-megawatt project (developed by Ørsted and Eversource)\n.\nNYSERDA announced finalized contracts with Empire Offshore Wind LLC and Sunrise Wind LLC on June 4, 2024.\nClick here to jump down to the downloadable contracts\n.\nThe fourth offshore wind solicitation advances the actions set forth by Governor Hochul in the State’s\n10-Point Action Plan\n, which offers insights on how the Governor’s Administration plans to overcome macroeconomic and inflationary challenges that have impacted the renewable energy sector. The competitively-selected projects will create more than 800 near-term construction jobs and invest $2 billion in near-term enhanced economic development statewide, including developer-committed investments to support disadvantaged communities. The projects, totaling over 1,700 megawatts of clean energy (enough to power one million New York homes), will be the largest power generation projects built in New York State in over 35 years once they enter operation in 2026, and will continue progress towards achievement of the State’s Climate Act goal to develop.\nEmpire Wind 1 and Sunrise Wind were previously awarded by NYSERDA in 2019 as part of NYSERDA’s first offshore wind solicitation. As part of these awards, the projects will be held to new contract provisions that bring additional benefits to the State, including:\nNew economic benefit commitments above what was originally contracted, including $32 million committed to community-focused investments in New York’s disadvantaged communities and $16.5 million toward wildlife and fisheries monitoring.\nCommitment to purchasing a minimum of $188 million of U.S. iron and steel, supporting investments in the U.S. manufacturing and the New York Buy American Act.\nRequirements for Labor Peace Agreements for operations and maintenance services.\nTogether, Empire Wind 1 and Sunrise Wind are expected to deliver $6 billion in in-state spending and support nearly 1,000 jobs over the lives of the projects. They will deliver a host of benefits in line with Climate Act goals, with over $1 billion invested in disadvantaged communities, $117 million supporting minority, women-owned, and veteran-owned businesses, and over $43 million in workforce investments.\nThis award will usher in the construction and operation of the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal assembly and staging port, jump-starting over 400 construction jobs this year to transform the currently inactive 70-acre waterfront site in a disadvantaged community into a thriving offshore wind port. The projects will also invest more than $80 million in construction and manufacturing associated with advanced foundation components at the Port of Coeymans, and continue to make investments totaling $135 million in electric grid infrastructure on Long Island and $200 million in transmission related investments, backed by a Project Labor Agreement with Long Island skilled tradesmen and women, including heavy equipment operators, electricians, and line workers.\nEmpire Wind 1 and Sunrise Wind are now on a path to project completion, driving local investments and enhanced economic benefits to New York State at cost-competitive rates. The average bill impact for customers over the life of these projects will be approximately 2%, or about $2.09 per month. The weighted average all-in development cost of the awarded offshore wind projects over the life of the contracts is $150.15 per megawatt-hour, which is on-par with the latest market prices.\nFor more information on the awarded projects, please see\nNew York’s Offshore Wind Projects\nwebpage.\nClosed Solicitation, ORECRFP23-1\nOn November 30, 2023,\nNYSERDA announced the launch of New York’s fourth competitive offshore wind solicitation\nas part of New York’s 10-Point Action Plan to bolster the State’s growing large-scale renewable industry. The expedited solicitation supports progress toward achieving New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Climate Act) goals of sourcing 70% of New York’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and developing 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035.\nOn January 25, 2024, NYSERDA received responses to New York’s fourth offshore wind solicitation with six total bids for three projects from three offshore wind developers, including Community Offshore Wind LLC with the Community Offshore Wind 2 project, Empire Offshore Wind LLC with the Empire Wind 1 project, and Sunrise Wind LLC with the Sunrise Wind project.\nOn October 26, 2023, NYSERDA issued a\nRequest for Information\nto solicit public comment on proposed adjustments to this Request for Proposals, including an expedited timeline and streamlined evaluation process. Based on that feedback, this fourth solicitation includes key provisions to advance New York’s responsible and forward-thinking approach to growing the State’s offshore wind portfolio while meeting the needs of the industry and growing market.\nTo allow for expedited preparation and review of proposal submissions,\nsubmission requirements have been significantly streamlined\ncompared with ORECRFP22-1. Bid fees have also been reduced.\nORECRFP23-1 provides flexibility for a variety of proposals, including for projects that currently hold contracts with NYSERDA but commit to conditional termination.\nNYSERDA’s updated policy regarding OREC agreement termination and contract security is detailed in Section 2.1.1.1 of the RFP\n, which replaces and supersedes the policy that was published on November 16, 2023.\nIn addition to required Environmental Mitigation Plans, Fisheries Mitigation Plans, Stakeholder Engagement Plans, and New York Workforce and Jobs Plans, Proposers must\ndemonstrate a detailed understanding of potential benefits and burdens to Disadvantaged Communities\nfrom their projects. This requirement aligns with the principles of a just transition outlined in the Climate Act.\nConsistent with ORECRFP22-1 and promoting the intent of the New York Buy American Act, the solicitation sets a minimum U.S. iron and steel purchase requirement for all projects awarded to encourage domestic steel production and requiring developers to provide opportunities for\nU.S.-based steel suppliers\nto participate in the growing offshore wind industry.\nAs was the case in ORECRFP22-1, to help ensure the long-term viability of projects, Proposals may include a price structure where the project’s price would be subject to a one-time adjustment to reflect changes in certain price indices subsequent to the Proposal Submission Deadline. Proposals may also include a price structure that contemplates an Interconnection Cost Sharing approach. Proposals including these adjustments will be evaluated as described in Section 4 of the RFP.\nSubmitted Proposals\nThe public versions of the ORECRFP23-1 proposals are included below:\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC – Empire Wind 1\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 Executive Summary\n[PDF]\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 Project Schedule and Status\n[PDF]\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 Project Development Plan\n[PDF]\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 Interconnection and Deliverability Plan\n[PDF]\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 Fisheries Mitigation Plan\n[PDF]\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 Environmental Mitigation Plan\n[PDF]\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 Stakeholder Engagement Plan\n[PDF]\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 Disadvantaged Community Impacts\n[PDF]\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 Visibility Study\n[PDF]\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 Economic Benefits Plan\n[PDF]\nEmpire Offshore Wind LLC –\nEmpire Wind 1 New York Jobs and Workforce Plan\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC – Sunrise Wind\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind Executive Summary\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind Project Schedule and Status\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind Project Development Plan\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind Interconnection and Deliverability Plan\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind Fisheries Mitigation Plan\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind Environmental Mitigation Plan\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind Stakeholder Engagement Plan\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind Disadvantaged Community Impacts\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind Visibility Study\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind Economic Benefits Plan\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind LLC –\nSunrise Wind New York Jobs and Workforce Plan\n[PDF]\nORECRFP23-1 Solicitation Schedule\nEvent\nDate (all times ET)\nRFP Release Date\nNovember 30, 2023\nResponses to Written Questions\n[PDF]\nPosted January 16, 2024\nNYSERDA Portal Open for Registration\nJanuary 16, 2024\nNYSERDA Portal Closed for Registration and\n-\nOpen for Proposal Submission\nJanuary 19, 2024\nProposal Submission Deadline\nJanuary 25, 2024, 3:00 p.m. ET\nNYSERDA Award Notification Date\nFebruary 29, 2024\nContracts Executed\nEmpire Wind 1 OREC Purchase and Sale Agreement\n[PDF]\nSunrise Wind OREC Purchase and Sale Agreement\n[PDF]\nMay 31, 2024\nORECRFP23-1 Documents\nRequest for Proposals (ORECRFP23-1) (Updated December 29, 2023)\nAppendix A - Proposer Certification Form\nAppendix B.1 - Economic Benefits Claims and Documentation Requirements\nAppendix B.2 - Disadvantaged Community Impacts\nAppendix C - Elements of the Fisheries Mitigation Plan\nAppendix D - Elements of the Environmental Mitigation Plan\nAppendix E - Elements of the Stakeholder Engagement Plan\nAppendix F - Meshed Ready Technical Requirements\nAppendix G - New York Jobs and Workforce Plan\nAppendix H - Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate Standard Form Purchase and Sale Agreement (Updated December 29, 2023)\nRedline of Appendix H vs Nov 30 version (Updated December 29, 2023)\n[PDF]\nAppendix I - Offer Data Form\nAppendix J - Master Offers Form\nAppendix K.
