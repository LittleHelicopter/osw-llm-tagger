NYSERDA competitively selected three projects:\nAttentive Energy One\n(developed by TotalEnergies, Rise Light & Power, and Corio Generation),\nCommunity Offshore Wind\n(developed by RWE Offshore Renewables and National Grid Ventures), and\nExcelsior Wind\n(developed by Vineyard Offshore).\nOn October 24, 2023, NYSERDA provisionally awarded three offshore wind projects: Attentive Energy One (1,404 MW), Community Offshore Wind (1,314 MW), and Excelsior Wind (1,314 MW). NYSERDA also provisionally awarded $300 million of New York State grant funding to GE Vernova and LM Wind Power for nacelle and blade manufacturing in New York’s Capital Region, which was associated with the provisionally awarded projects. Subsequent to the provisional award announcement, material modifications to projects bid into New York’s third offshore wind solicitation caused technical and commercial complexities between provisional awardees and their partners, resulting in the provisionally awarded parties’ inability to come to terms. Of note, GE Vernova’s offshore wind turbine product pivot away from the initially proposed 18 MW Haliade-X turbine platform to a 15.5/16.5 MW platform caused material changes to projects proposed into ORECRFP22-1. Given these developments, NYSERDA announced in April 2024 that the solicitation concluded and no final awards were made.\n2022 Solicitation Map\nShow Map Information\nShow Map Information\nHide Map Information\nHide Map Information\nThe map displays the locations of the three offshore wind projects awarded as part of NYSERDA’s 2022 solicitation, as well as proposed points of interconnection. All three projects are located south of Long Island in the New York Bight.\nAttentive Energy One:\nproposed to interconnect at the Ravenswood Site in Astoria, Queens.\nCommunity Offshore Wind:\nproposed to interconnect at the Con Edison Clean Energy Hub in Brookyln.\nExcelsior Wind:\nproposed to interconnect at the East Garden City Substation in Nassau County.\nClosed Solicitation, ORECRFP22-1\nOn July 27, 2022, Governor Hochul announced the\nrelease of New York’s third competitive offshore wind solicitation\n, seeking enough clean, renewable energy to power at least 1.5 million New York homes. The third solicitation included the first phase of a nation-leading $500 million investment in offshore wind ports, manufacturing, and supply chain infrastructure, as announced during the 2022 State of the State Address.\nOn January 26, 2023, NYSERDA received a robust response to New York’s third offshore wind solicitation, with more than 100 total proposals for eight new projects from six offshore wind developers – representing a record-setting level of competition among East Coast states.\nOn\nApril 4, 2023\nand\nMay 12, 2023\n, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued guidance regarding the Inflation Reduction Act which provides increased clarity regarding eligibility requirements for certain tax credits available to offshore wind projects. To ensure robust and competitive pricing, NYSERDA provided all Proposers with an opportunity to submit updated offer pricing to reflect this guidance as well as other clarifications issued in accordance with the solicitation.\nOn July 27, 2023, NYSERDA issued an addendum to ORECRFP22-1 to ensure the most cost-effective outcome of the solicitation for ratepayers. As part of this addendum, NYSERDA provided a clarification to all bidders and offered another opportunity for updated pricing to ensure the most competitive award group. Bid prices could not be adjusted upwards and no other changes to bids were allowed.\nA\ndraft version\nof the solicitation was released for public comment in March 2022, and a follow-up\nrequest for Information\nwas released in May 2022 to ensure that the procurement advances New York’s offshore wind goals in a thoughtful, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible manner to the benefit of all New Yorkers. During the two public comment periods, NYSERDA received over 1,300 comments from over 60 stakeholder groups and individuals representing the development community, labor, academia, manufacturing, environmental organizations, ratepayers, and others. In addition to the Request for Information process, NYSERDA hosted an\ninformation webinar\n[PDF]\non the Supply Chain Investment Plans (SCIPs) related to ORECRFP22-1 and the $500 million in New York State funding for offshore wind infrastructure on July 14, 2022.\nThis third solicitation includes key initiatives to advance New York’s responsible and forward-thinking approach to growing our offshore wind portfolio. The 2022 solicitation reflects step changes in New York State Public Service Law, Public Service Commission Orders, and priorities expressed by Governor Hochul in the\n2022 State of the State Address\n[PDF]\n:\nSupply Chain Investment Plans (SCIPs)\nare required and will support the development of a strong, local supply chain that will not only create jobs for New Yorkers but help bolster the State’s standing as a regional hub for offshore wind manufacturing.\nDue to the reduced footprint in transmitting energy from offshore wind projects to shore, high voltage direct current (HVDC) technology will be required for all projects where cables will be installed in areas of constraint. If HVDC is used, projects must be\nMeshed Ready\nto strengthen reliability and provide redundancy. These features also permit more flexibility for future offshore wind projects. Please refer to Appendix G to learn more about these requirements.\nProposals must include\nStakeholder Engagement Plans\nand\nNew York Workforce and Jobs Plans\nto ensure alignment with the principles of a just transition outlined in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (“Climate Act”).\nIn promoting the intent of the New York Buy American Act, the solicitation sets a minimum U.S. iron and steel purchase requirement for all projects awarded to encourage domestic steel production and requiring developers to provide opportunities for\nU.S.-based steel suppliers\nto participate in the growing offshore wind industry.\nProposers may submit plans to\nrepurpose existing downstate fossil-based electric generation infrastructure\nin alignment with Governor Hochul’s 2022 State of the State priorities to enhance future system reliability and support more renewable energy on the grid. Proposers must submit a timeline and studies to support the proposal that consider local requirements and plans to address the just transition of generation plant workers.\nThis solicitation allows for\neconomic benefits\nassociated with\nEnergy Storage\nand other\nclean energy and decarbonization investments\n. Investments may include pilot and demonstration projects that complement offshore wind development, including innovative storage projects such as Clean Electrolytic Hydrogen.\nSubmitted Proposals\nThe
