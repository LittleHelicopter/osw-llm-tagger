issued on October 12, 2023 (the October 2023 Order), NYSERDA seeks to procure Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Credits (ORECs) through a fifth solicitation (ORECRFP24-1).
The fifth offshore wind solicitation advances the State’s progress to develop offshore wind energy in alignment with the State’s
10-Point Action Plan
and the goals of the
Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Climate Act)
. It is part of a sequential approach to allow the offshore wind supply chain to develop in coordination with offshore wind energy projects, each on their own timeline. The approach includes three solicitations, beginning with this OREC solicitation. For more information, please visit the
Supply Chain webpage
.
On September 9, 2024, NYSERDA received 25 proposals in response to ORECRFP24-1 from four offshore wind developers representing 6,870 MW in total offer capacity. Public versions of the proposals are posted below.
On October 18, 2024, NYSERDA received Offer Pricing for 21 proposals, and Attentive Energy withdrew its 4 proposals.
Closed Solicitation, ORECRFP24-1
On July 17, 2024, NYSERDA launched New York’s fifth competitive offshore wind solicitation.
As part of this solicitation, NYSERDA has included key provisions from the latest rounds of renewable energy procurements such as inflation indexing, Disadvantaged Community commitments, and related priorities to maintain the policy objectives introduced in prior solicitations intended to ensure an equitable energy transition for all New Yorkers.

Include commitments to negotiate project labor agreements and labor peace agreements
Submit environmental and fisheries mitigation plans describing development practices that will minimize impacts to fisheries and the environment
Submit stakeholder engagement and workforce development plans to ensure alignment with the just transition priorities of New York’s Climate Act
Participate in New York State’s offshore wind technical working groups: Environmental, Commercial Fishing, Jobs and Supply Chain, Maritime, and Environmental Justice

Make environmental data collected during site assessment publicly available
Implement lighting controls to minimize nighttime visibility
