2022 Offshore Wind Solicitation (Closed)
Under the New York State Public Service Commission’s (PSC)
Order Establishing Offshore Wind Standard and Framework
[PDF]
for Phase 1 Procurement, issued on July 12, 2018,
Order Adopting Modifications to the Clean Energy Standard
[PDF]
issued on October 15, 2020 in Case No. 15-E-0302, and most recently in the
Order on Power Grid Study Recommendations
[PDF]
issued on January 20, 2022 in Case Nos. 20-E-0197, 18-E-0071, and 15-E-0302, NYSERDA sought to procure Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Credits (ORECs) through this third solicitation (ORECRFP22-1). NYSERDA competitively selected three projects:
Attentive Energy One
(developed by TotalEnergies, Rise Light & Power, and Corio Generation),
Community Offshore Wind
(developed by RWE Offshore Renewables and National Grid Ventures), and
Excelsior Wind
(developed by Vineyard Offshore).
On October 24, 2023, NYSERDA provisionally awarded three offshore wind projects: Attentive Energy One (1,404 MW), Community Offshore Wind (1,314 MW), and Excelsior Wind (1,314 MW). NYSERDA also provisionally awarded $300 million of New York State grant funding to GE Vernova and LM Wind Power for nacelle and blade manufacturing in New York’s Capital Region, which was associated with the provisionally awarded projects. Subsequent to the provisional award announcement, material modifications to projects bid into New York’s third offshore wind solicitation caused technical and commercial complexities between provisional awardees and their partners, resulting in the provisionally awarded parties’ inability to come to terms. Of note, GE Vernova’s offshore wind turbine product pivot away from the initially proposed 18 MW Haliade-X turbine platform to a 15.5/16.5 MW platform caused material changes to projects proposed into ORECRFP22-1. Given these developments, NYSERDA announced in April 2024 that the solicitation concluded and no final awards were made.

Community Offshore Wind:
proposed to interconnect at the Con Edison Clean Energy Hub in Brookyln.
Excelsior Wind:
proposed to interconnect at the East Garden City Substation in Nassau County.
Closed Solicitation, ORECRFP22-1
On July 27, 2022, Governor Hochul announced the
release of New York’s third competitive offshore wind solicitation
, seeking enough clean, renewable energy to power at least 1.5 million New York homes. The third solicitation included the first phase of a nation-leading $500 million investment in offshore wind ports, manufacturing, and supply chain infrastructure, as announced during the 2022 State of the State Address.
On January 26, 2023, NYSERDA received a robust response to New York’s third offshore wind solicitation, with more than 100 total proposals for eight new projects from six offshore wind developers – representing a record-setting level of competition among East Coast states.
On
April 4, 2023
and
May 12, 2023
, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued guidance regarding the Inflation Reduction Act which provides increased clarity regarding eligibility requirements for certain tax credits available to offshore wind projects. To ensure robust and competitive pricing, NYSERDA provided all Proposers with an opportunity to submit updated offer pricing to reflect this guidance as well as other clarifications issued in accordance with the solicitation.
On July 27, 2023, NYSERDA issued an addendum to ORECRFP22-1 to ensure the most cost-effective outcome of the solicitation for ratepayers. As part of this addendum, NYSERDA provided a clarification to all bidders and offered another opportunity for updated pricing to ensure the most competitive award group. Bid prices could not be adjusted upwards and no other changes to bids were allowed.
A
draft version
of the solicitation was released for public comment in March 2022, and a follow-up
request for Information
was released in May 2022 to ensure that the procurement advances New York’s offshore wind goals in a thoughtful, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible manner to the benefit of all New Yorkers. During the two public comment periods, NYSERDA received over 1,300 comments from over 60 stakeholder groups and individuals representing the development community, labor, academia, manufacturing, environmental organizations, ratepayers, and others. In addition to the Request for Information process, NYSERDA hosted an
information webinar
[PDF]
on the Supply Chain Investment Plans (SCIPs) related to ORECRFP22-1 and the $500 million in New York State funding for offshore wind infrastructure on July 14, 2022.
This third solicitation includes key initiatives to advance New York’s responsible and forward-thinking approach to growing our offshore wind portfolio. The 2022 solicitation reflects step changes in New York State Public Service Law, Public Service Commission Orders, and priorities expressed by Governor Hochul in the
2022 State of the State Address
[PDF]
:
Supply Chain Investment Plans (SCIPs)
are required and will support the development of a strong, local supply chain that will not only create jobs for New Yorkers but help bolster the State’s standing as a regional hub for offshore wind manufacturing.
Due to the reduced footprint in transmitting energy from offshore wind projects to shore, high voltage direct current (HVDC) technology will be required for all projects where cables will be installed in areas of constraint. If HVDC is used, projects must be
Meshed Ready
to strengthen reliability and provide redundancy. These features also permit more flexibility for future offshore wind projects. Please refer to Appendix G to learn more about these requirements.
Proposals must include
Stakeholder Engagement Plans
and
New York Workforce and Jobs Plans
to ensure alignment with the principles of a just transition outlined in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (“Climate Act”).
In promoting the intent of the New York Buy American Act, the solicitation sets a minimum U.S. iron and steel purchase requirement for all projects awarded to encourage domestic steel production and requiring developers to provide opportunities for
U.S.-based steel suppliers
to participate in the growing offshore wind industry.
Proposers may submit plans to
repurpose existing downstate fossil-based electric generation infrastructure
in alignment with Governor Hochul’s 2022 State of the State priorities to enhance future system reliability and support more renewable energy on the grid. Proposers must submit a timeline and studies to support the proposal that consider local requirements and plans to address the just transition of generation plant workers.
This solicitation allows for
economic benefits
associated with
Energy Storage
and other
clean energy and decarbonization investments
. Investments may include pilot and demonstration projects that complement offshore wind development, including innovative storage projects such as Clean Electrolytic Hydrogen.
