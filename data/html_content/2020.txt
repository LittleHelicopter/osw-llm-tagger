Back to Offshore Wind Solicitations
2020 Offshore Wind Solicitation (Closed)
Under the
Public Service Commission Order Authorizing Offshore Wind Solicitation in 2020
, NYSERDA competitively selected and finalized contracts with Empire Wind Offshore LLC and Beacon Wind LLC, each a 50-50 partnership between Equinor and bp, for the Empire Wind 2 and Beacon Wind offshore wind projects.
The 1,260-megawatt Empire Wind 2 and 1,230-megawatt Beacon Wind projects were aimed to drive investments in ports to directly support offshore wind projects, provide significant economic benefits to disadvantaged communities and support the responsible retirement of aging fossil fuel plants in Queens and Nassau County.
On January 3, 2024, a Joint Termination Agreement between Empire Wind Offshore LLC and NYSERDA was announced terminating the Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate (OREC) Purchase and Sale Agreement for Empire Wind 2.
On January 25, 2024, NYSERDA and Beacon Wind LLC (Beacon Wind), a joint venture between Equinor and bp, entered into an agreement to terminate the Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate (OREC) Purchase and Sale Agreement for Beacon Wind.
NYSERDA remains committed to advancing clean energy at the best value for New Yorkers and is optimistic that between the more than four gigawatts conditionally awarded under New York’s third offshore wind solicitation (NY3 or ORECRFP22-1) and the bids received under the fourth solicitation (NY4 or ORECRFP23-1), progress will continue apace toward the States renewable energy goals.
Clean energy, including offshore wind, has proven to be a strong economic driver and will play a pivotal role in creating short- and long-term economic development in the State as New York begins to
build back better

Closed Solicitation, ORECRFP20-1
On July 21, 2020 New York took a major step in advancing the State’s nation-leading climate agenda with the announcement of the largest combined solicitations for renewable energy ever issued by a U.S. state seeking 4,000 megawatts.
ORECRFP20-1, NYSERDA’s second offshore wind procurement, sought up to 2,500 megawatts of offshore wind and a complementary multi-port infrastructure investment.
